# Todo Project

I used Bootstrap and Vanilla JavaScript in this Project. I also made the design responsive.

Features:

- You can add new todos

- You can delete your todos

- You can move your todos to the “done” list

- You can filter your todos with search bar

- Todos consisting only of space characters are not accepted.

- Toasts are used instead of alerts and confirm methods


Features I plan to add next:

- Localstorage

- Drag&Drop

- Adding dates for todos
